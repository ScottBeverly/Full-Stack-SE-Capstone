          <p>   Peel Team Six is a guild created by a handful of friends wanting to change 
            the atmosphere found within most other guilds in June of 2017. With a democratic
             leadership in place, we are able to ensure every person is heard and any possible 
             negative situation is handled fairly and properly. While pushing content that is current
              and difficult, we are also able to focus on being true to what was originally 
              intended-a community dedicated to helping others and ensuring everyone has a home 
              to feel comfortable and included within the game.
